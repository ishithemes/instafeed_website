# Instafeed on your website 

This is a simple way to showup instagram feeds on your website using the latest API from instagram. Due to recent API changes of instagram, a lot of people are suffering due to broken API. Hence this is an attempt to get instafeed on your website up again or set up instagram feeds on a brand new website :) 

## Requirements 
* A Facebook developer account, and an Instagram account with some media posted to it. 
* A Facebook app linked to your Instagram account, and a token generated through that app. 

## Installation 
* Add the HTML(index.html) code to your web page. 
* Create a Facebook app linked to Instagram, and add the instagram account as a test user. This account must be the one from which you want to show up feeds on your website. See [Managing User Tokens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2ndbJAnQKM) 
* Copy the created access token and put it in the HTML file. 
* All set. Now you will be able to see the feeds on your website. 
* Do not worry if you are still not able to get it. There is a video tutorial that explains you these steps in action.
